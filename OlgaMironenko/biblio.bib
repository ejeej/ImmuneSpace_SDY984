	abstract = {Immunization is a cornerstone of public health policy and is demonstrably highly cost-effective when used to protect child health. Although it could be argued that immunology has not thus far contributed much to vaccine development, in that most of the vaccines we use today were developed and tested empirically, it is clear that there are major challenges ahead to develop new vaccines for difficult-to-target pathogens, for which we urgently need a better understanding of protective immunity. Moreover, recognition of the huge potential and challenges for vaccines to control disease outbreaks and protect the older population, together with the availability of an array of new technologies, make it the perfect time for immunologists to be involved in designing the next generation of powerful immunogens. This Review provides an introductory overview of vaccines, immunization and related issues and thereby aims to inform a broad scientific audience about the underlying immunological concepts.},

	abstract = {Herpes zoster (shingles) causes significant morbidity in immune compromised hosts and older adults. Whereas a vaccine is available for prevention of shingles, its efficacy declines with age. To help to understand the mechanisms driving vaccinal responses, we constructed a multiscale, multifactorial response network ({MMRN}) of immunity in healthy young and older adults immunized with the live attenuated shingles vaccine Zostavax. Vaccination induces robust antigen-specific antibody, plasmablasts, and {CD}4+ T cells yet limited {CD}8+ T cell and antiviral responses. The {MMRN} reveals striking associations between orthogonal datasets, such as transcriptomic and metabolomics signatures, cell populations, and cytokine levels, and identifies immune and metabolic correlates of vaccine immunity. Networks associated with inositol phosphate, glycerophospholipids, and sterol metabolism are tightly coupled with immunity. Critically, the sterol regulatory binding protein 1 and its targets are key integrators of antibody and T follicular cell responses. Our approach is broadly applicable to study human immunity and can help to identify predictors of efficacy as well as mechanisms controlling immunity to vaccination.},

	abstract = {To elicit protective adaptive immune responses, vaccines must efficiently trigger the innate immune system. It is becoming increasingly apparent that microbial and host nucleic acids serve as important activators of the innate immune system in both currently available and experimental vaccines.Microbial and host nucleic acids may be recognized, respectively, as pathogen-associated molecular patterns ({PAMPs}) and damage-associated molecular patterns ({DAMPs}) by a complex machinery of innate immune receptors. The activation of these receptors either directly or indirectly has an impact on the activity of antigen-presenting cells and on subsequent adaptive immune responses.The deconstruction of the mechanisms of action of many live attenuated vaccines is revealing that the sensing of microbial nucleic acids makes an important contribution to the immunogenicity of these vaccines.Innate immune detection of host {DNA} and of the nucleic acid metabolite uric acid may have a role in the adjuvant properties of aluminium salts, the most widely used type of vaccine adjuvant.Nucleic acid-sensing mechanisms may be directly harnessed by novel adjuvant molecules. Several vaccines containing such molecules are currently in the preclinical and early clinical stages of development.},

	abstract = {With the increase in genomewide experiments and the sequencing of multiple
 genomes, the analysis of large data sets has become commonplace in biology. It
 is often the case that thousands of features in a genomewide data set are
 tested against some null hypothesis, where a number of features are expected
 to be significant. Here we propose an approach to measuring statistical
 significance in these genomewide studies based on the concept of the false
 discovery rate. This approach offers a sensible balance between the number of
 true and false positives that is automatically calibrated and easily
 interpreted. In doing so, a measure of statistical significance called the
              q
              value is associated with each tested feature. The
              q
              value
 is similar to the well known
              p
              value, except it is a measure of
 significance in terms of the false discovery rate rather than the false
 positive rate. Our approach avoids a flood of false positive results, while
 offering a more liberal criterion than what has been used in genome scans for
 linkage.},

	abstract = {Several studies have shown that the pre-vaccination immune state is associated with the antibody response to vaccination. However, the generalizability and mechanisms that underlie this association remain poorly defined. Here, we sought to identify a common pre-vaccination signature and mechanisms that could predict the immune response across 13 different vaccines. Analysis of blood transcriptional profiles across studies revealed three distinct pre-vaccination endotypes, characterized by the differential expression of genes associated with a pro-inflammatory response, cell proliferation, and metabolism alterations. Importantly, individuals whose pre-vaccination endotype was enriched in pro-inflammatory response genes known to be downstream of nuclear factor-kappa B showed significantly higher serum antibody responses 1 month after vaccination. This pro-inflammatory pre-vaccination endotype showed gene expression characteristic of the innate activation state triggered by Toll-like receptor ligands or adjuvants. These results demonstrate that wide variations in the transcriptional state of the immune system in humans can be a key determinant of responsiveness to vaccination.},
